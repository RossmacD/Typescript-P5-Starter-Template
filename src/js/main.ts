/*************************************************************
*   MAIN.TS
*   This file is the main entrypoint Typescript file which bootstraps the html and css also
*   I decided to to it in this way rather than directly bundling the sketch as it allows it to be more modulur in the future
*
*   Webpack on its own is a bit overkill and adds some developemnt overhead but allows code to be moved into a Webpacked React
*   or Vue project for example
